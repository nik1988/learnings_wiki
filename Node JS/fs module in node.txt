----------------- fs module in node is used to read write and delete from files-----

followig are the methods supported by file system module:

readFile -- reads the file from given path
readFileSync -- reads the file synchronously from given path
appendFile -- update the file with data, if files not present creates the file.
writeFile -- write the file to given path.
unLink -- delete the file from given path.

example:
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('./hello.txt',(err,data) => {
	if(err){
		console.log('errrr');
	}

	console.log(data.toString()); //need to convert data to string other wise data will be in hexa format
});

//sync calls
const file = fs.readFileSync('./hello.txt');
console.log('readFileSync',file.toString());
