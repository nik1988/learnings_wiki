----------------------- Why Js frameworks are needed and what real problem does it solve ----------------------------------


Ideally we hear UI frameworks have below advantages":

-- Easier to maintain
-- COomponent Based approach
-- Routing
-- Shadow/Vitual dom etc


But this was not the real issues which brought UI framework into the picture,Actual Prblem it solved was 

				State Management: i.e keeping the UI in sync with data
				
Basically managing state was difficult and required us to write husge amounts of code.
				
Quetion is How:

Back in the days we used to use Jquery to manage state of the UI and manipulate dom as shown in below example:

let says we have an html code which prints the shopping list:


	<div id = "loop"> item1 </div>
	
now if we want to add html element based on some dynamic array and add some css based on selection our jquery code would look like:

var loopData = ['Apples', 'Bananas', 'Milk']

$.each(loopData, function(index, value) {
  $('<div>' + value + '</div>')
    .click(function() {
      $(this).toggleClass('highlighted')
    })
    .appendTo($('#loop'))
})

above code is difficult to understand and maintain. With complex UI it becomes worst



------------------ In vue.js we can achieve something like above as shown below --------------------------

new Vue({
  el: '#output',
  data: {
    shoppingList: [
      { name: 'Apples', selected: false },
      { name: 'Bananas', selected: false },
      { name: 'Milk', selected: false },
    ],
  },
})

-------------- Html --------------------------

<div id="output">
  <div
    v-for="item in shoppingList"
    v-on:click="item.selected= !item.selected"
    v-bind:class="{highlighted: item.selected}">{{ item.name }}</div>
</div>



we can see code is cleaner and easier to understand

othere than this there are several other advantage in terms of UI performance because of shadow dom rendering.
