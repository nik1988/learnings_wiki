-- we can run node terminal by simlpy running node command in cmd and executing this command opens the node
terminal.

once this terminal is opened we can run java script code as usual.


-- node doesnot have a window object which is parent object in java script instead it has a object global which provide bunch of method to perform tasks.
-- node also doesnot have a document object.
-- node has a process object which indicates current process running inside a terminal. if we do process.exit() we will come out of node terminal.



----------------- running a java script file inside a node terminal -------------------------

when we simply want to run the js file in terminal we must give : require('./<<filename>') // where ./ indicates the current folder , in case file is located some place please provide the complete path.
example:

require('./script.js')

--------- running js file outside the terminal -----------------

we can simply open the cmd where file is located and execute : node <<filename>>.js

example: node script.js


-------- exporting modules in node js ----------------

currently node js doesnot support Javascript ES6 as we see when we use import and export in react ,so it uses common.js to support module import and export.

example:

lets say we have script1.js file which contains and some common large number:

script1.js


cont commonLargeNumber = 3650;

module.exports =  {largeNumber:commonLargeNumber};  // export it to make it possible to be included in other modules.


----------------- Now script2.js can include exported module as below in node --------------------


const exportedNumber = require('./script1.js');

const a = exportedNumber.largeNumber;
const b = 5;

console.log(a + b);



-------------- different moudles in node js ------------------

other kind of module in node js is existing modules.

example of existing modules are : http,fs etc


we can import existing modules as : const c = require('fs');
