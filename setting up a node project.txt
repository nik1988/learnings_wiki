
------- setting up node project -------------------

under node project folder we must run npm init -y so that project is initialized and package.json is created.

------------------installing nodemon to node project. ---------------------------

node mon detects changes on the fly and execute and gives error in case of syntax errors.

for installing node mon we must run npm install nodemon --save -dev under package.json file .

now once it has installed we can see the entry for nodmon in package.json under devDependencies.


---------- note: nodemon gets installed under devDependencies----

usally when we install packages it gets listed under dependencies although , items listed under dependencies are such which are used only for dev environment and doesnot get deployed under live server.


------- running the node mon -----------------------

in order to run the node mon we go to package.json file and we add "start":"nodemon" under scripts, example:

"scripts": {
   "start":"nodemon"
  },
  
  after that we can run npm start under node folder, after we do that we see the live server running and any time we make changes to the js file it will be executed automatically . we donot have to run the scripts manually again
  and again after we make change to the scaript.
