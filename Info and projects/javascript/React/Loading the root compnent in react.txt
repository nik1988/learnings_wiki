----------- Rendering the Components in React App --------------------------------


we know that the root file in any webapp is index.html and index.js by default


in react app bu default under index.js we will find

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

here is App is the App.js file defined in react

ReactDom.render states that place the app component file under html element which have id as root

In index.html we have

<div id="root"></div> // ReactDom.render will place the app component under this div in html
