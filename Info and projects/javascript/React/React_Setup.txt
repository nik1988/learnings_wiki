 we can use the tool "create-react-app" to have the initial setup for the react project which will
 contain all the rquired files such as 
-babel
-WebPack
-Lint and Debug

we can install it using npm install -g create-react-app from command line 


once we have installed the react app , we must go to location for our project and do

create-react-app robofriends in cmd and it will create a robo-friends folder with all the necessary dependencies, 


Now if we go to the package.json file for the react app we see below under dependencies

  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },


by running npm start we can run the react app

eject is used when we dont want to use scripts defined under react-scripts but want to have custom scripts.


manifest.json provides feature download your webapp and have short cut icon on desktop.

favicon.ico is to have icon file for which shows along with title on the browser tab.
