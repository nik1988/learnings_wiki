------------------------ props.children in React -----------------------------------


Till now we were creating self closing component in react, but what if we want to apply one component on top of another 

example suppose we have created a scrollable component and we want to make our component scrollable by wrapping it under the scrollable component as below:

<Scroll>

	<CardList />
</Scroll>


so here we have two components Scroll and CardList, question is how do we render cardlist component inside Scroll component.


for example if we define our scroll component as 

	
const scroll = props => {
	return (
		<div> // some code >  </div>
};

export default scroll;


what will happen here is code defined inside scroll will overlap card list component and  content inside cardlist component will not be displayed.



-------------- ThereFore we must use props.children to render all the enclosed components inside a parent component ---------------------------


Even if we dont pass properties every component has default properties associated with and we can use them to access child/enclosed component using properties.children as below:



const scroll = (props) => { // access default props note: we can access default properties using any name here we are using props
	return (
		<div
			// css code for scrollable

			{props.children}  // render the encloded component using props

		</div>
	);
};
