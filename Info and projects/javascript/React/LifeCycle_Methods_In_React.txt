React comes with some set of predefined lifecycle methods along with component:

These are divided into three sections:

 -- Mounting
 -- Updating
 -- Unmounting


----------- Mounting  ---------------

When a component is mounted for the first time following is the list of methods that are executed in sequence:

constructor()  // initialize using construtor
static getDerivedStateFromProps() // 
render()  // render the component 
componentDidMount() // exeute this component when the component is rendendered. // if we want some set of code after the component has rendered this is the method we can use.



note: If the method is not defined in our component it is simply ignored



-------------------- Updating ---------------------------


When the property or state chnages then an update happens and following methods are executed in sequence:


static getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()

render()

getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
componentDidUpdate()


-------------------- Unmounting --------------------------------


when we chnage the url component is unmounted , following is the method which is called after unmounting

componentWillUnmount()
