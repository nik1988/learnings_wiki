-------------- what is redux middleware --------------------------

basically when ever actions communicate with reducer it does is through a react middle ware, middleware act as tunnel between action and a reducer and using middle ware action deterimines whih reducer to take.



we can use this middleware to configure actions or make them better.



------------------------ logging previous state curren actin and new state in react. -----------------------------

to log redux apps we can install a library called as redux logger using npm install redux logger


redux logger provides a method called as createLogger and we can invoke this method in index.js to create a logger as shown below:



const logger = createLogger(); //note we import createLogger from import {createLogger} from 'redux-logger';



now we can pass the logger to redux middleware to log all the state chnages automatially as shown below:


here apart from creating store we will also pass applyMiddleware which applies logging for this particular reducer

const store = createStore(searchRobots,applyMiddleware(logger)); // we can import applyMiddleWare from redux


after that upon every action we can see logs in console as shown below:


 prev state {searchField: "a"}
  action     {type: "CHANGE_SEARCH_FIELD", payload: ""}
payload: ""type: "CHANGE_SEARCH_FIELD"

 next state {searchField: ""}

...............

redux middle ware makes it easier for us to deug a react app.


----------------- we also have some thing called as redux dev tools which is a cool library to debug react apps ---------------------------
