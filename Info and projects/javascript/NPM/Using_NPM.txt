------- we can search for packages in NPM site and install it using npm install

----- npm install pacakges in two ways
		
		-- globally (using -g) exmaple: npm install -g << package name >>
		-- locally  example : npm install << package name >>

with global install , installed module will be available for any of the projets in the system.

with local install , installed module will only be available for current project and entry will be made to
package.json file for the current project.


example: if we want to install lodash library locally we can do

npm install lodash, and in package.json file we can see entry for lodash under dependencies and "node modules" folder will be created

"dependencies" : {

	"lodash": "^4.17.4"
}


similarly whatever modules we install will be added to the dependencies.



------- we we set up an existing project we can only we need to run
					
					
				"npm install"


and it will automatically pick up depencies present under package.json and install them


------------------------- scripts in package.json ------------------------------------------


scripts in the package .json file provides us an easy way to confiure and run some default sripts which are required by our project example

for example,

we have installed a browserify script to create a bundle and liveserver to create a live server for the projet and for running each of these we need to do below:

	everytime we add changes to the script we need to create a bundle like this 

		browserify script.js > bundle.js

similary for creating a live server we need to run liveserver 


instead of doing this we can configure this in package.json under scripts and execute 
		
						npm run build

example:

	"scripts": {
			
		"build": "browserify script.js > bundle.js && liveserver" 	
		
		   }

and we can simply execute both using 
					npm run build
