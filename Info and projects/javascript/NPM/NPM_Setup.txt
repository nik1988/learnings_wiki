----- we need to install node.js which comes with NPM

for all the current features to work:

-- npm version should be higher than 5.5.1
-- node version should be higher than 8.9.1

after installing node.js we can check the version using npm -v and node -v

and if these versions are lower we can run : npm install npm@latest -g



---------------- Setting UP NPM when we start a project --------------------------------------

when we start a projet we go to the pproject folder in command line and we run

			" npm init "

as soon as we run npm init in our project folder it will ask few questions about description, version, name etc
and then it will create a package.json file
