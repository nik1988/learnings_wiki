
--------------- Create an anonymous thread for a block of code in class which is taking more time to execute so that it executes parallely without blocking the main class---------------------

we had line of code in class "FontFactory.registerDirectories()" which was blocking the class for 50 secs in term causing the screen freeze while UI loading


in order to solve abobe problem we decided to execute as part of anonymous thread as it may execute parallely while the UI loads

way to create anonymous thread :


Runnable runnable = new Runnable (){

public void run(){

// your code to execute parallely
FontFactory.registerDirectories();
}
};

Thread t = new Thread(runnable);
t.start(); // execute your code as a separate thread;







------------------------- No class def found error / no such method error ...........................................

we were facing issue where we were getting no class def found error although correct jar was present

this error happens in case of 2 scenarios:

1.Either the jar itself is not present.
2.Different version jars are present in code.

In our code multiple copy of same jar with different versions were present,need to delete the jar with older version to fix the issue.

Search for the class it is throwing error to identify the jar it belongs to then, then check for the jar in lib.
