Browser converts the html into dom tree, you can see the respresentation of dom tree in below link:

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp


this dom model is represeted in javascript as document object, if type document; in js console u will see the entire html,

document object provides set of methods which can be used to manipulate html dom.

example:document.write("helooooo"); will replace the entire dom with text "Heloooo";

similarly if we want to modify body of an html dynamically we can use document.body() method.

---------------  parent object of all the objects in java script -------------------

parent object for all the objects in java script is "window"

if any of the functions which directly belongs to window we can directly invoke them without reference of window 

for example we invoke alert(); directly, js automatically tries to look for such mehtods in window object therefore

window.alert() is same as alert();



------------------- Java Script engines used by different browsers -----------------------

every browser has its own js engine to interpret javascript on the client side, these are as below:

 --- Chrome has V8 engine. 
 --- FireFox has spider monkey js engine.
 --- Explorer has chakra js engine.
