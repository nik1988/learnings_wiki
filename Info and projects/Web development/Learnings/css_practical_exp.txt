
--------------- Creating a background image in css-----------------------------

while creating a background image for web page i was seeing background was scrollable and background-image was not in center.


to avoid background image from becoming scrollable we can use display:flex; or d-flex class of bootstrap.

example:
<html>
<head> <title></title> </head>
<body>
<header class = "startup"></header>
</body>
</html>

 --- CSS -----------

header.startup {

  display:flex;	
  background-image:url();
  background-position:center; // to position the image from center.	


}


------------ Fadding colour effect or faded text effect in css --------------

we can give the faded color effect by setting the opacity ib rgba tag

color: rgba(255,255,255,0.8);
