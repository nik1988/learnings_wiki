
---------------- difference between prompt and an alert ---------------------

prompt() -- allows user to provide an input

example : var num = prompt("Enter the number");


alert() -- just shows an alert to a user.

example: alert("This is just an alert");


------------- converting string to number in javasript ------------------

by default whatever value we receive in var is string we can convert the var to number using Number()

example

var input = prompt("enter a number");

var sum = 10 + Number(input); // converting the input to number type.


-------------------- different ways to create a funtion in javascript -----------------------

There are two ways to create a function:

1. normal way: function functionName() { // function code }
2. function as an expression as shown below :

	var test = function(){
		
				// function code 
			}

this is also called as an anonymous function , what is the use for this way we will see later.


---------- just for info undefined type in java script --------------------

when we execute something in javascript console we often see undefined as a result, what is this undefined

-- undefined is one of the types in javascript and if our block of code/operations does not return anything it will return as 
undefined by default. 

For example:

if we go to console and execute something like :

 function testfunction(){

5*4;
}

testfunction(); // call the method
 
response in the console would be "undefined", but if we return something from this function for example

function testFunction() { return 5 *4; }
testFunction(); // now the output will be 20.


-------------- Arrays in Java Script -------------------------------


we can create an array in java script using : 

var test = ["test1","test2","test3"];

we can create array of arrays using : animalTypeList =  [ [dog,cat], [elephant,zirrafee], [whale,dolphin], [Tiger,Lion]);

and we cam acess each array witin an array using :

animalTypeList[1,1] -- will print zirrafee (2nd element of second array)
and so on,


common method used in array:

 --- push( << items to push >> ) : animalTypeList.push(["snake","mongoose"]);

if we push multiple items using push like animalTypeList.push("test1","test2") ,two separate arrays "test1" and "test2" will be added
to animalTypeList array,where animalTypeList is array of array.

--- concat( << items to add in array >>) : concat add the elements at the end of an array and returns a new array.


note: concat appends items to the array and return a new array so the o/p of comcat must be assigned to new array other wise 
it will end up creating new array and we wont be able to use it.

one more point if we are trying to add multiple items using concat in array of array, it will add all the items into a single array and
concat this array to array of arrays and return a new array of arrays.

example: newAnimalList  = animalList.concat("sea_cucumber","transparent_fish");

this will return a new list by after appending the items to current list and without effeting the current list.


-- pop() : Removes an item from an end of array.

-- shift() : shifts all elements by one position towards right. 
example: list  = ["tiger","cat","beer","bird"];

list.shift(): will return string tiger , now items present in the list will be ["cat","beer","bird"];



--------------------------- Obects in Java Script -------------------------

objects is one of the types in java script.

Note: other types in java script are string,number,boolean,null, undefined

---- creating an object

we can create object as below example:
	
	var student = {
			 name:"Nik", // note that for strings u need to provide " " other wise you will get error unidentified identifier.
			 age:31,     // properties should be terminated by  << , >> not by << ; >>
			 company:"Micro Focus",
			 spell:["abrakadabra","shazam","boo"],	 // adding array to object;			

			 specialSkill:function(){		// this is how we define method inside a obejct;		
				alert("He is allways Single");
			 }
		    };		
				

 --  we can acess properties or methods define in object by simply doing user.name, user.age , user.specialSkill(); etc
 --  we can dynamically add properties to the  object example:
	
			student.gender = male; // will add property gender to the object student.

  ---------- dynamically add method to the object ---------------
	
	we can add a method dynamically as beklow"
	
			student.test = function() {
							// code here
						};

	will add the method test to the object student.

---  differnce between the term " method " and " function " , generally function is called a method when it is a part of object.


				
-- we can also create an empty object using eg: var emptyObject = {};



----------------------- Looping , forEach method in java script------------------- -------------------

rest of the looping concepts are same as java , although for each is little different in java script.

for example:

va todos = ["Clean Room","Exercise","Study Javasript","Eat Food","Sleep"];

now to iterate through this todo list we can use forEach method as 

todos.forEach( 

	function (todo){
			
			console.log(todo); // will print the value persent in array "Clean Room","Exercise" etc.

});

if we also want to print the index we can do :
s
todos.forEach( function (todo,i) {
	
	console.log(todo,i); 
)}
		
	

for each method is considered more readable and was introdued in EcmaScript 5. Otherway of looping include normal for loop.
