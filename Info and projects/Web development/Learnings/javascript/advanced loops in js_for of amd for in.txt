---------------------Differnce between the terms iterable and enumerable in java script -------------------------


arrays are called iterable and objects are called as enumerable in java script.



------------------- for of and for in for looping in java script -------------------------------

There are two other ways for looping in java script


for -of:

we can use for of for arrays

suppose we have an array like 

let fruits = ["apple","banana","grapes"];


	for(fruit of fruits)
		{ 
			console.log(fruit)

		}


for in:

we can use for in to iterate through object keys:

suppose we have 

let student = {name: "Nikhil", age: 30, nature: "simple"}
;

			
		for(property in student) 
			{ 
			console.log(property) //will print the properties(keys) of an object.

 
			}
o/p
name
age
nature


Note: we can use for in for iterating arrays because underlying array is represented as object in javascript 

example:

fruit{
	0:"apple",
	1:"banana",
	2:"grapes"
}

so if we do 

for(fruit in fruits){ consle.log (fruit) }

// output would be
0
1
2
