 -------------- what are callback function in java script --------------------

we should know that every function in java script is a objet thus we can assign to variable 

example:var fn = function() { //some code }

and we can assign this function variable to any variable we want and use it for example

fn1 = fn; and then we can call the same function as fn1();


----- callbacks -------

Callbacks are functions that are executed asynchronously or at later time.Instead of code reading top to
bottom procedurally, async programs may execute different functions at different times.

----callback functions can be passed as an argument to other functions without () ------------

callback function means function will be called back once the certain tasks has completed.


example:

function add(a,b,callback){
	
 var sum = a + b;
 console.log(sum);
 callback()	 // execute the call back function	

}

function disp() {

console.log("this method is called after sum has completed");
}


add(5,10.disp); //notice here disp is called without ();

callback functions are genearlly used when api acess or http requests are used as they take time to complete and once they fetch data , other related functions must get exeuted to use that data.






example2:

button.addEventListener("click",somemethod); // here also somemethod is a callback function which is only called when click event is generated.
