  -------------- cloning an object in java script using Object.assign() --------------------

 we can clone an object in java script using Object.assign method i.e it makes the copy of source object and returns the new object

Following points to know about Object.assign:

-- It clones the source object and returns the new object

	example: target = Object.assign(sourceObject);

-- we can also modify the existing object using assign as shown below:

	newObject = Object.assign(targetobject,sourceobject); // it  will return the newObject as well as copy the source object into the target object
	or
	newObject = Object.assign(targetobject, ...sources);

-- newObject returned in this case will have properties of source as well as target object.

-- If the target object have the same properties then property values will be replaced by the source object.otherwise if there are different properties present in target
   object it will retain all of it properties and contain the properties of the source
-- if the source object contains another object then it will only create a refernce of this object for the target object, in case we want new object to be created for all
   underlying objects we need to use deep cloning.

-- we can clone object from multiple sources into single object
