-------------------- What is bind and why do we need bind in java script --------------------------

bind is used to bind the method to a context of an objet which we want to use, lets see an example to uderstand:

example:

let talk = {
	
	speak:"HI";
	say:function()
		{ console.log("this.speak")  // note: if we just fo console.log(speak); and try to invoke talk.say(); we will get an error as speak undefined by default if this is not present js looks for\
							variable definition in global scope.

		}

}

now when we do

talk.say() // prints HI

but when we do 

globalTalk = talk.say;

globalTalk(); // prints Undefined  why ???



let understand what will globalTalk = talk.say; imply to , this code is same as 


	globalTalk = function(){ console.log("this.test"); }  // here "this" represents which current object


 ----------- ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BEHAVIOUR OF JAVA SCRIPT IT DETERMINES THE CONTEXT BASED ON THE CURRENT INVOCATION POINT -------------------------------------


what does it mean ?


in above code  globalTalk is more of a function then a method 

ie point of invocation for globalTalk() is in global scope so JS will will resolve "this" objecct into a global object which is window

since window objet doesnot know what is speak it will say "undefined"



--------- WITH THE HELP OF BIND WE CAN FIX THE GLOBAL CONTEXT AND ATTACH THE OBEJECT CONTEXT FOR WHICH WE WANT TO MAKE A CALL-------------------------------

we can tell java script to call globalTalk under the context of talk as below


		globalTalk  = globalTalk.bind(talk) // this will bind globalTalk in under the cotext of Talk and "this" object within this method will resove to talk

now if we do :

	globalTalk() // prints Hi
