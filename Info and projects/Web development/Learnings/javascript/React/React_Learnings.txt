Most important point every  method in react must return only single element

example:

inside index.js if we want to return multiple card elements and if we do

reactDOM.render(
	
	<Card />
	<Card />
	<Card />
	<Card />, 
	document.getElementById('root'));

we will get an eroor beacause we are trying to retunr muliple card elements, to fix this we must wrap it under 
<div>

example:

ReactDOM.render(


	<div>	
	<Card />
	<Card />
	<Card />
	<Card />
	</div>, document.getElementById('root')); // here we are returning single html element div






----------------------- itration/java script operation under React Components -----------------------------------------


supoose we are retunrning div element from our component, in that case if we are perfoming any javascript operations inside the div element we must wrap it under curly braces {}.

Example:

lets say we have card list component which receives an array of robots whih returns list of cards with robots:



const cardList = ({robots}) => { // object destructuring from ES6

return (

		<div className = "tc m7"> // returns final div
		
		{	
			
			// java script code under curly braces
			
			
			// iterate through robot list and send the info to card compnent
			
		robots.map((robot,i) => {
			return (
				
				<Card 
				key = {i}  // key is extra info needed by react to keep track of each component , it fascilitates react for dom rerendering.
				name = {robots[i].name} 
				id = {robots[i ].id} 
				email = {robots[i].email}
				/>)

			})
		 
		}  // java script code over

		</div>
	)
}
