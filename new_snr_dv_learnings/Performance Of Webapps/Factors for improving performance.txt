There are 3 essential/fundamental factors we need to consider for performace

-- Network
-- Performance of web app in client side
-- Performance of web app on server side.



--- Considering Network Side --------

When we are talking about network side we are taking about time/latency it takes to load web app

When ever user enters the url of website, 
  -- Html , javascript and css is tranfered from server to client and client browser runs these to render the website, so more the size of these resources
     more bandwidth it will consume and more time it will take for app to load.
	 
	 so when we talk about network performance we are talking about optimizing the size of these resources (css, images, js etc) so that websote is rendered faster
	 
	 
----- factors to consider for reducing size
   
      -- size/format of image to be rendered
      -- size of js which is stored in server , how can we reduce it	  
	  
	  

--------- Size of Javacstipt -----------------------

when ever developer writes code for js there is allways space and indententios for the readibility of code, although in machine these newlines and spaces
are transalated into extra KB's which are not necessary for client browser to execute the code.

In order to decrease the size of js we can remove these indentions and space by using web sites which will convert it, In modern apps we have webpack bundler
which autoamtically removes these as part of build process.


-------- Size of images for performace ----------------

Size of images will be covered in seprate section
