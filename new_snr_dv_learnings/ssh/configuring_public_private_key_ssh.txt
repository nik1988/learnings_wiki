---------- How to configure assmertic encryption(public/private) key with host ------------------

it is also known as RSA setup

we need to follow below steps to acheive the same:

Step 1 : If you are using windows open powershell , and navigate to user location using cd command

for example: "c:/users/kaman"  kaman is the user 

Step 2 : look for .ssh folders, (here . represents hidden folder), in case hidden folders are disabled ,please navigate to folder and enable hidden folders , in case .ssh folder is not there then you 

Step 3 : access the folder in pover shell/ ssh terminal , and generate public and private key using ssh-keygen command ,

note: in order for ssh to work correctly you  need to ensure two services are enabled and running in windows machine

					OpenSSH Authentication Agent
					OpenSSH Server

 for this you can go to services.msc and enable and start these services.
 
 Step 4: once these services are started , go to power shell terminal and run below command to create public and private key
			
						ssh-keygen -C "test@gmail.com"  // -C is for comment

	you will be asked whee you want to save this file , so provide the location for example : /users/kaman/.ssh/id_rsa/digital_ocean

	you will be asked for password for extra security ,you can leave it blank and hit enter for now.
	and your key will be generated.

note: there are variety of options/recommendations we can use with keygen to generate key , we are using simplest possible option

 Step 5: now you will notice two files are created 
	
		id_rsa_digitalocean // private key
		id_rsa_digitalocean.pub // public keygen
		
  as we know public key can be shared and host using this public key will encrypt the message and who so ever is having the private key, can only
  decrypt the message. 
  
  there fore, we will copy the public key which will put in host machine for authentication in future steps.
  
 Step 6: Now we will go to power shell and access the host machine is normal ssh way by providing password and look for .ssh folder there.
 
		we can run ls -a command which will list hidden files
		
 Step 7: now we can acess the .ssh directory using ls and we will find authorized_keys file in there , we can open this file using
		
			nano authorized_keys 
			
	we can paste our public key here and hit (^X -- ctrl/cmd X) to exit.
    and exit out of machine

Step 8: now in order to access remote machine using RSA we need to add private key in out local machine , for that we need to access .ssh folder where
        our private key is present and run below command
		
		 ssh-add << your private key file name >>
		 example : ssh-add id_rsa_digitalocean
		 
		 you will see message id is successfully added. 
		 
		 
Step 9: Now yout RSA is setup and you can use ssh << host ip adress >> to directly access machine


 ------------ How does server identifies if client is secure / how client ensures secure pipeline ----------------------------
	Server sends a problem to client encrypted with public key, only client which has private key can decrypt it , so one the solution is sent by client
	host compares the key and if solution is righjt, secure connection is ensured
