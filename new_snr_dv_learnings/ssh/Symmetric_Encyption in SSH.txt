SSH works basically by following two encryption techniques :

 -- Symmetric Encryption
 -- Asmmetric Encryption



What is Symmertic Encryption

In Symmetric encryptionn  both client and share commonn key which can be used by both the parties to decrypt the encypted message. 
Bassically client shares the data encrypted with the shared key and server can use the same key to decypt the information.


Disadvantage with symmetric encryption:

if some one tracking the network can get hold of the key , he can also decrypt the data and get the information


Solution:

In order to prevent this we can use assymetric encryption.

Browesers use DHE_RSA algo to ecncrypt data.
