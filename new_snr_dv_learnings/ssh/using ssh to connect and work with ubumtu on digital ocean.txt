 
 
 --- we can create a basic ubuntu server in digital oceean and connect with it rempotely using windows/linux machine.
 
-- with ssh client comes with windows 10 as an optional update , with mac and linux it is already available.

let say we want to install git and node imn ubumtu server so that we can use git command (git clone) to clone project from github and use npm install
to install and run the project.

 step 1 : open the ssh client and connect with  ths server using
				
				ssh root@<<ip adress>> // ip adress would be of the server you have created in digital ocean
									   // root is the default super user in linux machines
									   
				it will ask user name and pass word , // provide same password/ ssh key which you have provided while setting up server
				
 step 2 : we can inatall any software in linux using 
					
								sudo apt get install <<package name>>
			
		some times we may get package not found so we can run  "sudo apt get update " and then sudo apt get install
		
			so we will run :
								
								sudo apt get install git 
								sudo apt get install node
 

 step 3: after these packages are isntalled we can run git clone 
 
			// may be this steps need to be done in local machine and transfer the files to remote macchine
					if your local machine is linux/mac you can use rsync else need to use putty for windows.
 
				in git we get two options to clonet the project 
						
						--using ssh
						--using https
						
			using ssh we can clone using git clone <<ssh key from git hub>> // for this we need to set up ssh with git hub
			other we can do
				git clone <<https url from github >> 
				
	 -- now onnce the project is successfully cloned we can go to the projuect directory and run npm install
