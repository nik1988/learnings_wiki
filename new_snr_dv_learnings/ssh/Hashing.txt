---- What is hashing and what is the need of hashing. -----

 Dffie hellmans algo can be broken if hacker acts a middle person between two systems, for example
 
 if hacker cretes a successfull pipe line between sender and receiver both.and decrypts the message sent by receiver and then encrypt and send the
 request the same request to receiver in turn getting the response which was supposed to be received by receiver.
 
 
 
 This prtoblem oh hacking can be solved by hashing which ensures sent message is no tampered before returning the response.
