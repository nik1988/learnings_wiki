--------- Assymetric Encryption -------------------------------------

-- This form of encryption is more secured as it involves two keys public and private for encryption of data
-- How Assymetric encryption is more secure  ?
	
	In this form of encryption private key is never shared over network and data cannot be decrypted with out , hence attacker can access exncrpted data
	but never really can decipher it.

-- How Assymetric encryption works  ?

 -- In Assymetric encryption both the systems will have private key and public key
 -- In order to establish communication both the computer will share there public key.
 -- private key cannot be calcuated from public key so evenn if attacker gets it he cannot generate private key to decipher messages
 -- sender will encrypt the meesages with receivers public key and receiver can only decrypt messages using its private key which are encrypted using it 
	public key.
 this way secure communication is established.

 
 --- the key exchange algorithm used for asymmetric communication is called "Difiie Hellman Key Exchange" algorithm.
